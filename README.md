# Predicting Tesla Stock Movements: Evaluating the Performance of Different Models:

Accurate stock price forecasting is a critical  challenge in finance, with significant implications for  investment strategies and decisions. In this study, we analyzed various time series forecasting models for stock price prediction, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), a hybrid LSTM-GRU model, Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA). We pre-processed a dataset of Tesla stock prices from the Yahoo Finance website during the preceding six years, including technology, before training the models on a 60% training and 40% testing set.

# Aim:
The aim of this project is to develop and evaluate advanced neural network models, including LSTM, GRU, and a hybrid LSTM-GRU, for accurately predicting Tesla stock prices, and to compare their performance with the traditional ARIMA model. This will demonstrate the effectiveness of neural networks in financial forecasting.

# Data Description:
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Yahoo Finance, consisting of historical stock price data for Tesla. The data includes the following attributes:

Date: The specific date for each record.
Open: The opening price of Tesla stock on the given date.
High: The highest price of Tesla stock during the trading day.
Low: The lowest price of Tesla stock during the trading day.
Close: The closing price of Tesla stock on the given date.
Volume: The number of Tesla shares traded on the given date.
Adj Close: The adjusted closing price, accounting for stock splits and dividends

# Tech Stack:
Language: Python
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit_learn, tensorflow.

# Approach
Objective: Predict Tesla stock prices accurately.
Data: Get historical Tesla stock data from Yahoo Finance.
Preprocessing: Clean and organize the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Understand patterns and relationships in the data.
Model Selection: Choose models like LSTM, GRU, LSTM+GRU, RNN, and ARIMA.
Training and Evaluation: Train models, test their performance using metrics.
Comparison: Compare models based on accuracy.
Prediction: Use the best model to forecast future stock prices.
Interpretation: Analyze results and provide insights.

# Conclusion:
In conclusion, our study highlights the superior predictive performance of advanced neural network models like GRU and LSTM+GRU over traditional ARIMA in forecasting Tesla stock prices. The LSTM+GRU hybrid model emerged as the most accurate, signaling the potential of deep learning techniques for financial forecasting in dynamic markets.
